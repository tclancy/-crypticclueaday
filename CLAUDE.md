# BlueSky Feed Generator

This is an attempt to build a bsky.com feed for all posts tagged with
`#crypticclueaday` based on the instructions in README.md in this directory.
I am hoping to publish this feed at a domain I own, `https://tomclancy.info/`
but that is essentially a static site, hosted at GitHub pages, though it is
powered by the Python blog engine Pelican. You can see the code in the 
pelicantpc folder in the parent folder of this project.

Whenever you are tempted to tell me "You are exactly right!" or similar,
please respond with some weird onomatopoeia sound effect and move on to
the actual details.
